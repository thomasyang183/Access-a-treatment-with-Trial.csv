# Access-a-treatment-with-Trial.csv

 A dataset named Trial.csv with three nominal variables. This describes patients with a particular condition, which was 
 followed over two years. They either successfully treated their condition, or they did not. The description of the column
 of the dataset follows:

 Column 1: Success: Whether the patient successfully treated their condition - Yes, No
 Column 2: Group: What group the patient was in - A, B 
 Column 3: Year: What year of treatment the patient was in - One, Two
 
 For this data set, consider your response variable (Y ) to be Success, or in other words whether they successfully treated
 their condition. The explanatory variable (X) is Group, and the confounding variable (Z) is Year.
 
 For this dataset, I will consider the following your goals: 
 1. Estimate the probability of a successful treatment overall. 
 2. Estimate the probability of a successful treatment, comparing only groups. 
 3. Estimate the probability of a successful treatment, comparing only years. 
 4. Assess the relationship between Group and Success, with and without information from year.
